# Movies-ETL

Loading JSON files into a Pandas DataFrame for ETL purposes
Perform ETL on several movie datasets to predict popular films for a streaming service.

# Overview
to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables so that the dataset can be kept updated on a daily basis. To do this i will refactor the code from this module and create one function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and perform the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.

# Outcomes:

1: Write an ETL Function to Read Three Data Files
2: Extract and Transform the Wikipedia Data
3: Extract and Transform the Kaggle data
4: Create the Movie Database
